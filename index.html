      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <div class="job">
        <h3>Researcher</h3>
        <p>
          As an undergraduate researcher in the Antibiotic Discovery stream at the University of Utah, I contribute to the search for novel antimicrobial compounds by isolating and characterizing soil-derived bacteria using culture-dependent methods. This research involves selective enrichment techniques, high-throughput screening against ESKAPE pathogens, and bioassay-guided fractionation to identify active compounds. Through this experience, I’ve developed hands-on proficiency in microbiology and molecular biology techniques, while contributing to clinically relevant research aimed at combating antibiotic resistance.
        </p>

      <div class="job">
        <h3>Senator</h3>
        <p>
          As a Senator in the Associated Students of the University of Utah (ASUU), I represent the College of Fine Arts in the university’s student government. In this role, I advocate for student interests, participate in legislative processes, and help oversee the allocation of college-level funding through the College Student Council. My work includes legislative drafting, event planning, student advocacy, and serving on committees that shape university-wide policy and governance.
